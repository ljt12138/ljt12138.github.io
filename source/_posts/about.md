# Basic information

I am Jiatu Li (李嘉图), a first-year graduate student at [MIT theory group](https://toc.csail.mit.edu/), advised by Prof. [Ryan Williams](https://people.csail.mit.edu/rrw/). I obtained my Bachelor's degree from ``Yao Class", Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Science (IIIS), Tsinghua University.

My research interests are about *circuit complexity*, *meta-complexity*, and *proof complexity*. Recently, I am interested in the following concrete directions:

- The strength of Bounded Arithmetic, the fragments of Peano that capture the *complexity of reasoning* (see, e.g., [Youtube Talk by Sam Buss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cD9lnxr9aJI)). Can we prove strong lower bounds in [Cook's theory **PV$_1$**](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/800116.803756) or [Buss's theory $S^1_2$](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/22145.22177)? Can we separate [Jerabek's theory **APC$_1$**](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-symbolic-logic/article/abs/approximate-counting-in-bounded-arithmetic/A7B01D53C883261836B93CD036B1FE9D) and Cook's **PV$_1$**? Can we identify the relative strengths of combinatorial principles and theorems as a feasible analogy of the program of [Reverse Mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_mathematics)? Our partial results: [APC vs PV](https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2023/038/), [reverse mathematics](https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2024/060/), [unprovability](https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2023/022/), [unprovability'](https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2024/083/)
- The complexity of the Range Avoidance Problem (see [Kor21](https://www.dcs.warwick.ac.uk/~igorcarb/complexity-meetings-files/OliverKorten-Talk.pdf), [RSW22](https://www.icms.org.uk/sites/default/files/downloads/Workshops/2022/Jul-2022/Tzameret/Hanlin%20Ren.pdf)). What is the computational complexity of finding a non-output of an $n$-input $(n+1)$-output circuit? What if the circuit is a restricted one, say, an **AC$_0$** circuit? Our partial results: [upper bound](https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2023/072/), [lower bound 1](https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2023/038/), [lower bound 2](https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2023/206/)
- Proving unconditional complexity lower bounds (e.g. [MW18](https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2017/188/), [Chen23](https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2022/183/), [CHR23](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.12912.pdf), [Li23](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17762)) and derandomization results (e.g. [CLORS23](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15140)). Our partial results: [catalytic](https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2024/106/), [general](https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2021/023/), [PRFs](https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2021/125/)

As complexity theorists, our mission is to liberate the warriors trying to solve inherently hard problems. Sometimes we can use their stories to alleviate insomnia for cryptographers (see, e.g., [Cryptographers Seldom Sleep Well](http://www.chenyilei.net/cryptographers-seldom-sleep-well.html)).

I am also interested in writing formal (i.e. computer verified) mathematical proofs in Coq and Lean. Although it seems to be incredible nowadays, I believe that proof assistants will eventually be able to help mathematicians in their research (if mathematicians are not completely replaced by something like GPT-256, see, e.g., [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/)).

# Interesting facts about me

- My name, Li Jiatu, is the same as the Chinese translation of *Ricardo*. My parents chose the name when they were reading *The Capital* of Karl Marx, in which the name *David Ricardo* occurs constantly.
- I learned Go (the chess game, not the programming language) when I was a kid and achieved amateur four-dan. Inspired by recent Livestreams of professional Go players in China, I'm now interested in playing go again. My ID on Fox Weiqi is jiatu1li (6d). I am a member of the MIT Go Club and you could probably catch me in the meetings (check <https://www.meetup.com/massgo/> for the schedule).
